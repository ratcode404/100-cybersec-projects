## CyberSec
Every day professionals and students are learning, creating and exploiting all types of systems. The internet is not only the most common means through which people interact and chat, but also a place where they are constantly exposed to a world where anyone can be monitored, exploited, tracked or scammed.

This is why us, programmers, take action; several of us continually try to protect this wonderful place while others, out of immaturity or shrewd interests, act in just the opposite direction. If you're interested in this field and want to join it, no matter your current level of knowledge, learning how to create your own tools will result in great advantage as a pentester.
